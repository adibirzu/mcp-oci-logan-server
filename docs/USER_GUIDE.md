# OCI Logan MCP Server - User Guide v1.3.0

## üö® Important Update - v1.3.0

**CRITICAL FIX APPLIED**: The `list_active_log_sources` tool now returns **complete, accurate results** matching the OCI Console exactly!

**Before v1.3.0**: Resource discovery questions returned only 1-2 sources (incomplete)
**After v1.3.0**: Returns ALL 12+ active sources with accurate log counts (complete)

This guide shows you how to get the most out of your OCI Logan MCP server.

## How to Ask Questions Effectively

The OCI Logan MCP server enables Claude to query and analyze your OCI Logging Analytics data. This guide explains how to interact with the MCP server for optimal results.

## üìã Quick Start Checklist

Before asking questions, ensure:
1. ‚úÖ OCI CLI is configured (`oci iam region list` should work)
2. ‚úÖ Python virtual environment is set up (`./setup-python.sh`)
3. ‚úÖ Claude Desktop config includes correct compartment ID and region
4. ‚úÖ You have access to the OCI compartment with Logging Analytics data
5. ‚úÖ **v1.3.0 or later installed** (for complete results)

## üéØ Best Practices for Asking Questions

### ‚úÖ DO: Ask Natural Language Questions

The MCP server is designed to understand natural language queries. Examples:

```
"Show me failed login attempts in the last 24 hours"
"Find all credential access techniques from MITRE ATT&CK in the last 30 days"
"Analyze activity for IP address 192.168.1.100"
"What security events happened yesterday?"
"List all available log sources in my environment"
```

### ‚úÖ DO: Be Specific About Time Ranges

The server understands various time expressions:

```
"Show me logs from the last hour"
"Find errors in the past 7 days"
"Get authentication events from the last 30 days"
"What happened in the last week?"
```

**Supported time ranges:**
- 1h, 6h, 12h, 24h (hours)
- 1d, 7d, 30d (days)
- 1w, 2w (weeks)
- 1m (month)

**Important:** For MITRE ATT&CK/Sysmon data, use at least **30 days** time range for meaningful results.

### ‚úÖ DO: Ask About Specific Security Events

The server has built-in understanding of common security patterns:

```
"Find privilege escalation attempts"
"Show me network anomalies"
"Detect potential data exfiltration"
"Find malware-related events"
"Show administrator login activity"
```

### ‚úÖ DO: Use Resource Discovery Questions

The server can help you understand what's available in your OCI Logging Analytics:

```
"What log sources are available?"
"Show me all log fields"
"List entities in my environment"
"What parsers are configured?"
"Show storage usage statistics"
"What labels are available for categorization?"
```

### ‚ùå DON'T: Ask About Dashboard Management (Limited)

Dashboard creation and modification tools are **partially implemented** and may return mock data:

```
‚ùå "Create a new dashboard for security monitoring"
‚ùå "Update my existing dashboard"
‚ö†Ô∏è  "List dashboards" (returns sample data, not real dashboards)
```

### ‚ùå DON'T: Expect Real-Time Alerts

The MCP server queries historical data. It doesn't provide real-time alerting or monitoring.

### ‚ùå DON'T: Ask About Non-OCI Data Sources

The server only accesses OCI Logging Analytics data in your configured compartment.

## üîç Types of Questions the MCP Server Handles Well

### 1. Security Event Analysis

```
"Find all failed authentication attempts from external IPs"
"Show me privilege escalation events grouped by user"
"Detect lateral movement patterns in my network"
"What are the most common security events?"
```

### 2. MITRE ATT&CK Investigation

```
"Show all MITRE techniques detected in the last month"
"Find credential access techniques (T1003)"
"What execution techniques have been observed?"
"Show me all tactics by frequency"
```

### 3. IP Address Investigation

```
"Analyze all activity for IP 10.0.1.50"
"Show authentication attempts from 203.0.113.45"
"What network connections involve 192.168.1.100?"
"Find communication patterns for this IP address"
```

### 4. User Behavior Analysis

```
"Show me activity for user 'admin' in the last week"
"Find users with unusual login patterns"
"What are the most active users?"
"Detect anomalous user behavior"
```

### 5. Resource Discovery

```
"What log sources are actively sending data?"
"List all available fields for querying"
"Show me entities of type 'host'"
"What parsers are available for JSON logs?"
"Show recent log uploads and their status"
```

### 6. Advanced Analytics

```
"Cluster security alerts to find patterns"
"Detect outliers in user activity"
"Show time-based clustering of events"
"Correlate authentication events with network activity"
"Find sequences of suspicious events"
```

## üìä Example Conversation Flow

### Discovery Phase
```
User: "What log sources are available in my environment?"
Claude: [Uses list_active_log_sources tool - v1.3.0 fix!]
Claude: "I found 12 active log sources with data in the last 60 minutes:

        1. OCI Audit Logs: 14,623 logs
        2. Database XML Alert Logs: 8,464 logs
        3. OCI Cloud Guard Problems: 6,721 logs
        4. OCI VCN Flow Unified Schema Logs: 5,840 logs
        5. OCI Service Connector Hub Logs: 2,656 logs
        6. Database Alert Logs: 593 logs
        7. OCI WAF Logs: 119 logs
        8. com.oraclecloud.dns.private.resolver: 116 logs
        9. Database Trace Logs: 84 logs
        10. OCI Events Logs: 41 logs
        11. OCI Object Storage Access Logs: 14 logs
        12. OCI_Monitoring: 12 logs

        Total: 39,363 logs across all sources"

User: "Show me what fields I can query"
Claude: [Uses list_log_fields tool]
Claude: "Here are the available fields: 'Event Name', 'User Name',
        'IP Address', 'Technique_id', 'Log Source', etc."
```

**Note**: The complete log source listing is thanks to the v1.3.0 critical fix!

### Investigation Phase
```
User: "Find failed login attempts in the last 24 hours"
Claude: [Uses search_security_events tool]
Claude: "I found 47 failed login attempts. Top 3 users:
        - admin: 23 attempts from 203.0.113.45
        - dbuser: 12 attempts from 10.0.1.50
        - testuser: 8 attempts from 192.168.1.100"

User: "Analyze the IP 203.0.113.45"
Claude: [Uses analyze_ip_activity tool]
Claude: "This IP shows suspicious behavior:
        - 23 failed authentication attempts
        - Connections to 5 different hosts
        - No successful logins observed"
```

### Deep Analysis Phase
```
User: "Are there any MITRE techniques associated with this activity?"
Claude: [Uses get_mitre_techniques tool]
Claude: "Found the following MITRE techniques:
        - T1110 (Brute Force) - 23 events
        - T1078 (Valid Accounts) - 5 events
        - T1021 (Remote Services) - 3 events"
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Getting incomplete log source list" (Only 1-2 sources shown)

**This indicates you're running an older version!**

**Symptom**: When asking "What log sources are available?", you only see 1-2 sources, but your OCI Console shows 12+ sources.

**Cause**: You're running a version before v1.3.0 that had the incomplete results bug.

**Solution**:
```bash
cd /path/to/mcp-oci-logan-server
git pull  # If using git
npm run build
# Restart Claude Desktop
```

**Verify the fix**: Ask Claude:
```
"What log sources are available in my environment?"
```
You should now see ALL 12+ active sources with their log counts.

### "No results returned"

**Possible causes:**
1. Time range too narrow (especially for MITRE data - use 30d+)
2. Incorrect compartment ID in configuration
3. Log sources not configured in OCI Logging Analytics
4. No data ingested for the specified time period

**Solutions:**
```
"Check my OCI connection status"
"What log sources are actively sending data?"
"Show me recent log uploads"
"List entities in my environment"
```

### "Query syntax error"

**Solution:**
```
"Validate this query: [your query]"
"Show me the documentation for query syntax"
```

### "Authentication failed"

**Solution:**
1. Test OCI CLI: `oci iam region list`
2. Check config: `cat ~/.oci/config`
3. Ask Claude: `"Check my OCI connection and tell me if there are any issues"`

### "Dashboard tools not working"

**Expected behavior:** Dashboard management tools (create, update, list) are partially implemented and may return sample data. This is a known limitation documented in the README.

## üìù Tips for Best Results

1. **Start broad, then narrow:** Begin with discovery questions, then focus on specific events
2. **Use appropriate time ranges:** 24h for recent events, 30d+ for MITRE data
3. **Leverage natural language:** Don't worry about exact query syntax
4. **Chain questions:** Build on previous answers for deeper investigation
5. **Verify assumptions:** Ask about available resources before querying specific data
6. **Use validation:** If you write custom queries, ask Claude to validate them first

## üîç Verifying Your Installation

### Check Your Version

To verify you have v1.3.0 or later with the critical fix:

```bash
cd /path/to/mcp-oci-logan-server
grep "Version" README.md | head -1
```

Should show: `**Version**: 1.3.0`

### Test the Fix

After installing v1.3.0, restart Claude Desktop and ask:

```
"What log sources are available in my environment?"
```

**Expected result (v1.3.0+)**:
- Shows 12+ active sources with individual log counts
- Matches your OCI Console exactly
- Total log count displayed

**Old behavior (pre-v1.3.0)**:
- Shows only 1-2 sources (incomplete)
- Missing most of your log sources

If you still see incomplete results, run `npm run build` again and restart Claude Desktop.
