# MCP Server Improvements & User Guidance

## Summary of Improvements

This document explains the improvements made to the OCI Logan MCP server and what users need to know to get better responses from the MCP.

### üö® CRITICAL UPDATE (Latest Fix)

**The `list_active_log_sources` tool was returning incomplete results!**

- **Problem**: Only returning 1-2 sources when console showed 12+ sources
- **Fixed**: Now returns ALL active sources matching the OCI Console exactly
- **Impact**: Resource discovery questions now work correctly

This was the most important fix - users asking "What log sources are available?" will now get complete, accurate answers.

## üîß Technical Fixes

### 1. üö® CRITICAL FIX: list_active_log_sources Now Returns Complete Results

**Problem:** The `list_active_log_sources` tool was only returning 1-2 active sources when the OCI Console showed 12+ sources with data.

**Root Cause:** The Python backend was using `execute_query()` which adds the time filter directly to the query string:
```sql
* and Time > dateRelative(1h) | stats count by 'Log Source'
```
This query pattern only returned 1 source due to how OCI Logging Analytics processes the combined filter+stats operation.

**Solution:** Changed to use `execute_query_like_console()` which sends the time filter as a separate `timeFilter` parameter (exactly like the OCI Console does), not embedded in the query string. This now returns ALL active sources.

**Result:**
- Before: 1 source returned (incomplete)
- After: 12 sources returned (complete, matching console)
- Query: `* | stats count by 'Log Source' | sort -count` (time filter sent separately)

**Impact:** Users will now see complete, accurate results when asking:
```
"What log sources are available?"
"Show me top 10 log sources with logs"
"List all active log sources"
```

**File Changed:** `python/logan_client.py:571-578`

### 2. Fixed Hardcoded Path Issue

**Problem:** The `QueryTransformer.ts` file had a hardcoded path to the Logan Security Dashboard project (`/Users/abirzu/dev/logan-security-dashboard`) that wouldn't work on other systems.

**Solution:**
- Added environment variable support: `LOGAN_PROJECT_PATH`
- Made the code check if the path exists before attempting to load
- Gracefully falls back to default queries if Logan project not found
- Users can now optionally set `LOGAN_PROJECT_PATH` if they have the Logan Security Dashboard project

**File Changed:** `src/utils/QueryTransformer.ts:27-51`

### 2. Updated Claude Desktop Configuration Template

**Problem:** The configuration template was missing important environment variables and didn't provide clear guidance.

**Solution:**
- Added `OCI_REGION` environment variable to the template
- Changed placeholder text to be more explicit about absolute paths
- Added `LOGAN_DEBUG` option for troubleshooting
- Made the template more user-friendly with better placeholders

**File Changed:** `claude_desktop_config.json.template`

**New template:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oci-logan": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/mcp-oci-logan-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "OCI_COMPARTMENT_ID": "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaa[YOUR-COMPARTMENT-ID]",
        "OCI_REGION": "us-ashburn-1",
        "SUPPRESS_LABEL_WARNING": "True",
        "LOGAN_DEBUG": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Corrected Documentation

**Problem:** Documentation incorrectly stated there were 19 tools when the server actually implements 33 tools.

**Solution:**
- Updated README.md to reflect correct tool count: **33 tools**
- Documented all 10 resource management tools that were missing from documentation
- Clarified which tools are fully functional vs. partially implemented

**Files Changed:** `README.md` (multiple sections)

## üéØ What Users Need to Do for Better Responses

### 1. Update Your Configuration

**Action Required:** Update your Claude Desktop configuration file with the new template:

**Location:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Add these environment variables:**
```json
"OCI_REGION": "us-ashburn-1",
"LOGAN_DEBUG": "false"
```

**Why:**
- `OCI_REGION` ensures queries go to the correct OCI region
- `LOGAN_DEBUG` can be enabled for troubleshooting

### 2. Ask Natural Language Questions

**The MCP is designed for conversation, not commands.**

**‚úÖ Good Examples:**
```
"Show me failed login attempts in the last 24 hours"
"What log sources are available in my environment?"
"Find all MITRE ATT&CK techniques from the last 30 days"
"Analyze activity for IP address 192.168.1.100"
"List all available fields I can query"
```

**‚ùå Avoid:**
- Don't try to write OCI query syntax unless you're experienced
- Don't expect dashboard creation/updates to work (known limitation)
- Don't ask about non-OCI data sources

### 3. Use Resource Discovery First

**Before diving into queries, discover what's available:**

```
"What log sources are in my environment?"
"Show me all available fields"
"List entities of type 'host'"
"What parsers are configured?"
"Show me recent log uploads"
```

**Why:** This helps you understand what data is available and prevents "no results" frustration.

### 4. Specify Time Ranges Appropriately

**Different data types need different time ranges:**

- **Recent events:** Use 1h, 6h, 24h
- **Security investigations:** Use 7d (7 days)
- **MITRE ATT&CK/Sysmon data:** Use **30d minimum** (30 days)

**Example:**
```
"Show me MITRE techniques in the last 30 days"  ‚úÖ Good
"Show me MITRE techniques in the last 1 hour"   ‚ùå Too narrow
```

### 5. Leverage Built-in Help

**The MCP has extensive documentation built in:**

```
"Show me documentation for query syntax"
"Get help with MITRE technique mapping"
"Show me examples of field operations"
"List available predefined security queries"
```

### 6. Chain Questions for Investigation

**Build on previous answers:**

```
User: "What log sources are available?"
Claude: [Lists log sources including Windows Sysmon Events]

User: "Show me failed logins from Sysmon in the last 24 hours"
Claude: [Executes query and shows 47 failed logins]

User: "Analyze the top IP from those results"
Claude: [Performs IP activity analysis]
```

### 7. Understand Limitations

**Dashboard tools are limited:**
- `list_dashboards` returns sample data (not real dashboards)
- `create_dashboard` and `update_dashboard` are mock implementations
- This is a known limitation documented in the README

**What works fully:**
- All core query tools ‚úÖ
- All advanced analytics tools ‚úÖ
- All resource management tools ‚úÖ
- All utility tools ‚úÖ

## üîç Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "No results returned"

**Solutions:**
1. Check time range (use 30d for MITRE data)
2. Verify compartment ID in config
3. Ask: `"What log sources are actively sending data?"`
4. Ask: `"Show me recent log uploads"`

### Issue: "Query syntax error"

**Solutions:**
1. Use natural language instead of writing queries
2. Ask: `"Validate this query: [your query]"`
3. Ask: `"Show me documentation for query syntax"`

### Issue: "Authentication failed"

**Solutions:**
1. Test OCI CLI: `oci iam region list`
2. Check `~/.oci/config` file exists
3. Ask Claude: `"Check my OCI connection"`

### Issue: "Dashboard tools not working"

**Expected behavior:** Dashboard management tools are partially implemented. Use resource management tools instead for discovering what's in your environment.

```

### 6. Start Investigating

```
"Show me failed login attempts in the last 24 hours"
"Find MITRE techniques in the last 30 days"
"Analyze activity for IP [your IP]"
```
