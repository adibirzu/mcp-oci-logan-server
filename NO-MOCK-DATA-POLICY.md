# No Mock Data Policy

## Overview
This MCP OCI Logan Server is configured to **NEVER return mock, sample, or fake data**. All responses contain real data from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging Analytics or appropriate error messages when data is unavailable.

## Implementation Details

### ✅ Real Data Only
- All query results come directly from OCI Logging Analytics API
- No hardcoded sample data or mock responses
- Every response includes metadata confirming data source: `"data_source": "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging Analytics"`
- Every response includes explicit flag: `"is_mock_data": false`

### ✅ Response Format Updates
All MCP tool responses now include:
- Clear indicators that data is real: "**Real OCI Data Retrieved Successfully**"
- Execution time and record counts from actual OCI queries
- Disclaimers: "*This data is retrieved directly from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging Analytics - no mock or sample data is used.*"

### ✅ Error Handling
When queries fail or return no results:
- Clear error messages explaining the real failure
- No fallback to mock data
- Explicit notes: "*No results found in OCI Logging Analytics for this query - this is real data, not mock*"

### ✅ Code Locations Updated

#### TypeScript (MCP Server)
- `/src/index.ts` - All tool handlers updated with real data validation
- `executeLoganQuery()` - Added success validation and real data confirmation
- `searchSecurityEvents()` - Added zero-result handling with real data messaging
- `getMitreTechniques()` - Added MITRE analysis real data validation
- `analyzeIPActivity()` - Added IP analysis real data confirmation

#### Python (OCI Client)
- `/python/logan_client.py` - Added metadata to all responses:
  - `data_source`: "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging Analytics"
  - `is_mock_data`: false
  - Notes for empty results confirming real empty data

### ✅ Query Templates vs Mock Data
The server includes query templates and documentation examples, but these are:
- **Templates for users to customize** - not returned as results
- **Documentation examples** - showing syntax, not fake data
- **Security patterns** - query structures, not mock events

### ✅ Validation
- All successful responses require `results.success === true` from OCI
- Failed queries throw errors instead of returning mock data
- Empty results are clearly marked as real empty results from OCI

## Testing
```bash
# Test that real data is returned with proper metadata
cd python
./venv/bin/python logan_client.py query --query "* | head 2" --time-period 60

# Response includes:
# "data_source": "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging Analytics"
# "is_mock_data": false
```

## Guarantee
This MCP server will never return mock, sample, fake, or placeholder data. All responses are either:
1. **Real data from OCI Logging Analytics** with proper metadata
2. **Clear error messages** when real data is unavailable
3. **Empty results** explicitly marked as real empty data from OCI

No fallback to mock data exists anywhere in the codebase.
